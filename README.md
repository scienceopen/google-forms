# google-forms

Analysis of Google Forms results, used with Blackboard.

Also a script to help translate messy spreadsheets of user data into Google Admin bulk user add format.
This script will likely need minor editing to fit your input data.
The output CSV should always be manually checked before upload to be sure it fits your security needs.
